    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p>I am a PhD student in Economics at Gothenburg University. My research interest broadly covers environmental and labor economics. My current research agenda focuses of the impacts of climate policy, such as a carbon tax, on firm and worker outcomes. I am on the academic job market 2024-25.

    <p> Climate Policy and Labor Demand [JOB MARKET PAPER] </p>
    <p>
    This project investigates the effects of carbon taxation on labor demand for different types of workers in Sweden. Using matched employer-employee data from the Swedish registers for the years 2004-2018, I estimate the effects of a reform that removed the carbon tax rebates for a subset of firms in the manufacturing and mining sectors. Using a difference-in-difference framework, I find that the reform significantly reduced emissions among treated firms; it also reduced the employment of workers without a high school degree. This effect is mainly driven by a reduction in the hiring rate of this group. The annual income of workers staying with the same firm over the time period does not seem to be affected by the reform. The results show that carbon taxation has heterogeneous impacts, and that complementary policies might be needed to address labor market inequalities.

        This paper estimates the effect of exogenous short-term temperature changes on the economy of the United States, using high-resolution data on monthly exports which has not been previously exploited in the literature. The detailed disaggregation of U.S. export data into sectors enables a top-down estimation of the net effect of temperature, while also identifying potential mechanisms at the micro level. Using an econometric specification which allows high parametric flexibility, I find significantly negative effects of both high and low temperatures. The magnitude of the effects corresponds to an average reduction of annual U.S. exports by 0.20%, following a uniform 2Â°C temperature increase. Industry heterogeneity in the temperature effect suggests disparate mechanisms behind hot and cold days, which are important to take into account when estimating the future economic damages of climate change in the United States.
