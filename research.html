    <p><a href="Climate Policy and Labor Market Inequality.pdf"> <b> Carbon Taxation, Firm Performance, and Labor Demand </b> </a> [JOB MARKET PAPER]</p>
    <p>
      This paper investigates the environmental and economic effects of carbon taxation, including the impacts on labor demand for different workers. Using matched employer-employee data from the Swedish registers from 2004 to 2018, I estimate the effects of a reform that increased the stringency of the tax for a subset of firms in the manufacturing sector. In a Difference-in-Differences framework, I find that the reform significantly reduced emissions, primarily through a switch to biofuels. However, it also reduced revenue and employment among emission-intensive firms. The negative employment effects are more pronounced for low-educated workers, suggesting a skill-biased effect of carbon taxation, although high-educated workers are also negatively affected at the most exposed firms. On average, the result corresponds to semi-elasticities of -0.58% per euro tax increase for emissions, and -0.20% for low-educated employment. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications for the green transition and labor market inequality.

    <p><b>Carbon Taxation and Local Labor Markets</b></p>
    <p>
      This project studies the effects of a carbon tax reform on local labor markets in Sweden. I exploit spatial variation in exposure to the reform which removed manufacturing rebates to the carbon tax from 2011 to 2018, based on the geographical distribution of affected firms. Using matched employer-employee population data, I develop a Difference-in-Differences framework which indirectly controls for confounders using the Generalized Propensity Score for continuous treatments. I find no significant effects on local employment rates or labor force participation. The heterogeneity analysis reveals similar zero-to-moderate employment effects regardless of education level. The result indicates low distributional costs of a higher carbon tax after allowing for local spillovers.

    <p><b>Climate Policy Shocks and Wage Adjustments</b></p>
    <p>
      This project studies rent sharing between firms and workers exposed to exogenous shocks induced by climate policy. Following the previous literature on productivity shocks and wage adjustments, I exploit fluctuations in permit prices under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to study the effects on profit and wages among Swedish regulated firms. I use matching techniques, comparing regulated firms with unregulated firms with overlapping characteristics, in combination with time variation in permit prices, to identify the effects of shocks to climate policy stringency. I allow for different effects for net buyers versus net sellers of pollution permits, in order to investigate whether wage effects depend on the sign of the shock.

    <p><b>Karlsson, J. (2021).</b> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-021-00587-5">Temperature and Exports: Evidence from the United States.</a> <i>Environmental and Resource Economics</i>, 80(2), 311-337.</p>
    <p>This paper estimates the effect of exogenous short-term temperature changes on the economy of the United States, using high-resolution data on monthly exports which has not been previously exploited in the literature. The detailed disaggregation of U.S. export data into sectors enables a top-down estimation of the net effect of temperature, while also identifying potential mechanisms at the micro level. Using an econometric specification which allows high parametric flexibility, I find significantly negative effects of both high and low temperatures. The magnitude of the effects corresponds to an average reduction of annual U.S. exports by 0.20%, following a uniform 2Â°C temperature increase. Industry heterogeneity in the temperature effect suggests disparate mechanisms behind hot and cold days, which are important to take into account when forecasting the future economic damages of climate change in the United States.</p>
